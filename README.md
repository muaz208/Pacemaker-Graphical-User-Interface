# Pacemaker-Graphical-User-Interface
Software Development Design Project

This project was a semester long course project where myself and 4 other students collaborated in deisgning a Pacemaker stateflow usuing Simulink in order to program various different modes of a pacemaker.

My role in the project was focused more toward developing a graphical user interface for the pacemaker hardware to be able to program various different pacemaker paramters as well as to view ECG data. The GUI was made usuing python and includes a fully functional login ans registration system (with a limit of 10 users) as well as serial communication to allow a user to modify the pacemaker settings.
