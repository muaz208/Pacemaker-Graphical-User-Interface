Welcome to our Pacemaker's GUI!

When cloning our repository, in order to run the interface you must change the directory at the top of the 
program's code to the path on your computer where the .txt files are saved. This allows you to login and be able to save your Pacemakers values.

As seen above, these two varaibles, user_var_location and user_file_location, can be found at the top of the PacemakerGUI.py file and these should point to
the UserInfo.txt files and the UserVars.txt files respectivley.
